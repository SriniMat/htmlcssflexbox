    <!--
      rgb - Red : Green : Blue (0 --- 255)
      Button           <--- Element Name
      subscribe-button <--- Class Lable , class lable can be referrend with '.','
    
      Margin           <--- Space in CSS , paragraphs come with default top and bottom margin
    
      hover            <--- adds psudo-pass...which implies , only those attribute values are overridden
      Active           <--- active styles are applied, when you click over the element.
    
      Opacity          <--- used to fade out an element ( values 0 - 1) where 1 is normal value.
    
      box-shadow       <--- (0,0,0,0) ===> (to-right horizontal, to-down vertical, percentage-blurred,color of the shadow (can be replaced with rgba))
    
      rgba             <--- rgb a stands for attribute (r,b,g, opacity 'how dark or faded the color to be '0 to 1' value')
    
      transition       <--- to make the change happen smoothly (back-ground color change, shadow etc...)
                            this property takes two parameters (what you want to transition, how long) 
                            transition: opacity 1s;
                            we can have multiple property transitions seperated by coma ','
                            transition: background-color 1s, color 1s;
    
      Development tools:
    
      CSS Box Model        <--- it shows how much Margin, Border and Padding an element (button, etc) has
    
      width                <--- in a paragraph decides the size of the line
      line-height          <--- decides the height of the line, which can be used to maintain the spacing between lines
    
      html entities        <--- used to have some special characters 
    
      Paragraph            <--- Once the Paragraph styles are applied, the specific class styles are applies and 
                                overrides the Paragraph styles. Paragraphs by default are Block Elements (they occupy entire row)
                            <--- Roboto is Google Font, Font Family provided the backup fonts in case the 
                                 Google font is not avaible for any reason, the next set of font styles are used.
    
      Text Elements        <--- They exists within the text statement, like <strong></strong> <u></u> <span></span>, etc..

      void Elements - link <--- link is one of the void element of html that does not need closing tag
                                When you are linking stylesheets using rel and href, we NEED NOT USE <style></style>  html tag

      rel                  <--- this rel attribute specifies the relation between the current document and the linked Document / Resource.
                                it has dirrent values like..., alternate, stylesheet, icon, next, prev etc...

      Basic HTML Elements
     1) Block Element (occupy entire line)
     2) Inline Block Element (they take only the amount of space they need of the entire line. Example image, text elements)
     3) Inline Element (they appear with in a line. Example <strong><\strong> <u><\u>)

     Windows snippet tool : windows + shift + s, then select rectangle...etc..

     Grid                  <--- Grid process helps fixing the gaps / spaces between the vertical and Horizontal pannels etc...
                                problems involved inline block - DISPLAY
                                Grids automatically adjust the width of the blocks within the grid.
                                if we add more columns that that defined in the Grid layout, the extra columns roll to the next line
                                -- 1 fr, implies the size of the column with remaining free space, after the defined columns size
                                -- if we have more that 1 fr defined in the columns of the grid, they take equal portions;
                                if we want the free space to be of different ratios...we can give it as 1fr, 2fr (1/3, 2/3 of the free spaces)

      Flex                <--- to have flexible width (increases and decreases with page size), 
                               we define  flex = 1 (for blexbox; i.e display=flex); instead of width = 20px
                               To stop the width of the flex element at some point, we define   max-width = 300px ,for flex element

                               flex=1 <--- is same as 1fr in grid (that occupies the remaining space)

      grid vs flexbox     <--- 1) similarity : 1fr ==== same as flex = 1 in Flexbox
                          <----2) Differences; Gird is rigid...where we define the size of the element...and the element width 
                                  is fixed as defined  in grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;  
                                  Where as in flexbox,the width of the elements is not regid and they take their width along with them like 
                                  flex = 1 or flex = 2 or even width = 100px etc...
      justify-contenet = space-between <---- what this does is , adjust the space between the flex elements when occupying the entire page
      align-item : start / stretch

      <input type="">     <--- input types could be text, checkbox....

      position : fixed / absolute
                          <--- Elements with Position: fixed are on the Browser WINDOW
                          <--- Elements with Position: Absolute are on the Web Page 
                               (mostly, as long as these elements are are not under Position = Fixed (implied Browser WINDOW))










      By Default, if a DIV2 is under another DIV1, DIV2 will appear in front and DIV1 will appear back /below DIV2.
      Also, elements with position STATIC, will appear on the Back (not front)
      z-index             <---- this allows us to position a DIV , overriding its sequence in the html;
                                elements with higher z-index come first than that of the elements with low z-index
                                the default z-index is zero (elements on the web page, have default z-index = 0)

      Position : absolute, element when placed within an position:  Fixed element; 
                 then that elements behaves position relative to the element with position : fixed; 
                 rather than relative to the position on the WebPage
      
      Position: relative  <---- if you define another element (with position:absolute) within this element; 
                                then the coordinates are relative to, this element with position:relateive, 
                                rather than relative to the Webpage.

      @media (media Query) is used to fit no. of columns per page size <600 , > 601  & <999 , > 1000

      shortcuts           <--- padding (instead of padding left,right etc..), margin (instead of margin left,right etc..)
